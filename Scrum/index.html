      <h2>* What is Scrum? Where is it from? Why did it arise?</h2>

      <p>
        - Scrum is a framework for developing (software) products in flexible
        way .Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland developed Scrum; the Scrum Guide
        is written and provided by them. To make everything more simple and
        eficient .
      </p>

      <h2>* How does Scrum relate to Agile working?</h2>

      <p>
        - *Scrum is an agile development methodology used in the development of
        Software based on an iterative and incremental processes*. Scrum is
        adaptable, fast, flexible and effective agile framework that is designed
        to deliver value to the customer throughout the development of the
        project.
      </p>

      <h2>* Why is Scrum specifically so suitable for development work?</h2>

      <p>
        - *Because Scrum provides an extremely lightweight structure to keep
        priorities in order, create a short-term plan, stay organized while
        executing, and creating a schedule forecast*
      </p>

      <h2>* What is the role of the Scrum master?</h2>

      <p>
        - The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including: -
        Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality; -
        Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet
        the Definition of Done; - Causing the removal of impediments to the
        Scrum Team’s progress; and, - Ensuring that all Scrum events take place
        and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox. The Scrum
        Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including: - Helping
        find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product
        Backlog management; - Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for
        clear and concise Product Backlog items; - Helping establish empirical
        product planning for a complex environment; and, - Facilitating
        stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.

      <h2>
        * What is a “Retro” (Retrospective)? What is/isn’t discussed during the
        Retro? When do you have a Retro (in which phase)?
      </h2>

      <p>
        - The Sprint Retrospective is the only event in Scrum that is exclusive
        to the Scrum Team. The intention is to create a safe space where
        everyone in the Scrum Team feels comfortable to openly share their
        observations and express their views and ideas. The purpose of the event
        is to inspect how the last Sprint went and plan ways to increase quality
        and effectiveness.
      </p>

      <h2>
        * What is a Refinement? What is/isn’t discussed during the Refinement?
        When do you have a Refinement (in which phase)?
      </h2>

      <p>
        - sometimes called product backlog grooming in reference to keeping the
        backlog clean and orderly—is *a meeting that is held near the end of one
        sprint to ensure the backlog is ready for the next sprint*.
      </p>

      <h2>
        * What is a Stand-Up? What is/isn’t discussed during the Standup? When
        do you have a Standup (in which phase)?
      </h2>

      <p>
        - The purpose of a daily standup meeting is to learn the current
        progress of every team member that works on Scrum tasks*.
      </p>

      <h2>* What is the Product backlog? What is and is not in it?</h2>

      <p>
        - Product Backlog is *an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to
        improve the product*.
      </p>

      <h2>
        * What is the Sprint backlog? What is and is not in it? How does this
        differ from the Product backlog?
      </h2>

      <p>
        - Sprint Backlogs give software development teams a way to chip away a
        long list of items. Teams use the Sprint Backlog in a very distinct way.
        They do not make changes to the Sprint Backlog. They set each Sprint
        Backlog at the Sprint Planning Meeting. - *The Sprint Backlog contains
        only the items of the Backlog specific to the current Sprint*. Sprint
        Backlogs are the songs. The complete Product Backlog is the album.
      </p>

      <h2>
        * What is a Burn Down Chart? What exactly is “burned”? What do you need
        to know this?
      </h2>

      <p>
        - A burndown chart is a tool used by Agile teams to gather information
        about both the work they have completed on a project and the work that
        is yet to be done within a given time period*, or as Scrum teams call
        it, a Sprint.
